# Template for emails for github username request

## Please note: this template can be copied and pasted into an email. It contains the maximum amount of information for someone who does not usually use Github so it can be adapted for anyone who is more familiar with it. 


Dear ____________,

Thank you for showing interest in the [FAIR Phytoliths Project](https://open-phytoliths.github.io/FAIR-phytoliths/). Please read our website to find out more about the project.

You can start to contribute in many way:
* Fill out our survey.
* Fix a typo in the repository or website.
* 

We would like to invite you to have access to the Github repository so that you can start to collaborate with us and therefore you need to send us your Github username.

If you don't have a Github account, then you can sign up for free here: https://github.com/

You will then receive another email inviting you to our repository. This means that you will be able to start working on the repository by commenting on issues (= tasks being done), reviewing pull requests (= reviewing work by others on the project before it is added into the main repository) and also working collabortively to add your own new content to the repository. 

We are very keen to have everyone associated with this project able to use Github and therefore we are very happy to take the time to teach you to use it. There are some resources you can look at here and we would be happy to spend time introducing how to use Github for collaborative work.
