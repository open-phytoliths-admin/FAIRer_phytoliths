* Short bio:
> I am an archaeologist with field experience in Bolivia, Brazil, India and Spain, specialising in phytolith analysis for archaeological and palaeoecological studies. In 2021, I obtained a PhD degree in History (Archaeobotany/Palaeoecology) from the Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona, Spain. My main interests are prehistoric cultivation systems, landscape evolution/anthropization and the development of new techniques for phytolith analysis.
