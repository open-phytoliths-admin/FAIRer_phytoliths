# Record of contributions

Contributions to The Turing Way may include but are not limited to, bug fixing, chapter planning, writing, editing, reviewing, idea generation, presentation, project management, and maintenance. We recognise all these contributions and acknowledge our community members fairly. For example, using all contributors bot we update the contributors table with each person's name, where the emoji keys indicate the different tasks they have done (see the README file). We understand that different contributions mean different things to people and may translate differently towards their personal interest, skill development, value exchange and advancement of their careers. Therefore, we also offer the contributors.md file as a dedicated location to capture personal highlights from The Turing Way community members.

Individual contributors are welcome to provide their details under the section "Personal Highlights from The Turing Way Contributors". Organisational support and collaborations are listed in the section, "Collaborating Organisations". Each organisation name and details will be listed separately followed by contribution details of each individual contributor from that organisation.

Please see the community handbook for details on how you can be fairly acknowledged for your work.
