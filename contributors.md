### Emma Karoune
* Role: **Core team (2021-ongoing)**
* GitHub account: [EKaroune](https://github.com/EKaroune)
* Social/academic media: [@ekaroune](https://twitter.com/ekaroune)
* Short bio: 
> I work as an open archaeobotanist to advocate for and model, as best i can, how to work openly in all aspects of research. I have been enjoying working on open science projects outside of archaeology such as my work with [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/), [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) and other projects at The Alan Turing Institute. My current research interests include improving the accessibility and inclusion of research in many different forms such as through different types of publications, access to training and also open data and workflows- this is linked to my work as an [SSI Fellow](https://www.software.ac.uk/about/fellows/emma-karoune). 
> 
> My archaeological work, as well as this project that aims to improve data sharing and open working in phytolith research, is focused on building robust methodologies for phytolith research in British Archaeology through the development of comprehensive references collections of the British Flora. Here is a poster about my recent fieldwork at [Farlington Marshes](https://aem.bsbi.org/exhibits/phytolith-reference-collection-of-coastal-plant-communities-at-farlington-marshes-portsmouth-hampshire/) in Hampshire, UK. 
* Project contributions:
> Project design and documentation, mentoring, GitHub maintenance and management, survey design and data analysis, community building and funding acquisition.

### Carla Lancelotti
* Role: **Core team (2021-ongoing)**
* GitHub account: [cl379](https://github.com/cl379)
* Social/academic media: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cl379), [GoogleScholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BShDEvMAAAAJ&hl=en)
* Short bio:
> I am an archaeobotanist and ethnoarchaeologist interested in human-environment interactions in drylands. Particulary I research the history of exploitation of the so-called "forgotten crops", such as millets and sorghum, from prehistory to modern times and how these are part of resilient socio-ecological systems. In my research I apply methods derived from archaeology, anthropology and plant science with a quantitative and moddeling approach.
* Project contributions:
> Project design and documentation, GitHub maintenance and management, survey design and data analysis, project dissemination and funding acquisition (in sum: a little bit of everything ;-)
* Other information:
> I opened a GitHub account before I even knew how to use it and what to use it for! I just knew instinctivly that I wanted to work collaboratively and with this project I can put my money where my mouth is.

* GitHub account: [jruizperez](https://github.com/jruizperez)
* Social/academic media: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/J_Ruiz_Perez), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Javier-Ruiz-Perez)
* Short bio:
> I am an archaeologist with field experience in Bolivia, Brazil, India and Spain, specialising in phytolith analysis for archaeological and palaeoecological studies. In 2021, I obtained a PhD degree in History (Archaeobotany/Palaeoecology) from the Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona, Spain. My main interests are prehistoric cultivation systems, landscape evolution/anthropization and the development of new techniques for phytolith analysis.
* Project contributions: 
> Design and creation of the GitHub repository, webpage, and survey for FAIR assessment of phytolith data and analysts. Management and maintenance of the repository and website. Dissemination of the project. Participation in securing funds.
* Other information:
> I have very recently become an advocate for the FAIRification of scientific data, in particular phytolith data, after meeting Emma Karoune and participating in the [Open Life Science program](https://openlifesci.org/) (Cohort 3, 2021) together with Carla Lancelotti and Marco Madella!
