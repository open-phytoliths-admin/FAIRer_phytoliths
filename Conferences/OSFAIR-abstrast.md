## Abstract

Our project ‘Increasing the FAIRness of phytolith data’, funded by EOSC-Life, is starting from the very beginning of implementing the FAIR principles, and community building is at the heart of our approach. 
Phytoliths are microscopic plant remains used to answer questions about human plant use, environmental change and plant physiology in archaeological, palaeoecological and botanical research. The phytolith community has started to standardise data through the development of a common nomenclature and other guidelines (Madella et al. 2005, Neumann et al. 2019, Portillo et al. 2020, Zurro et al. 2016). However, the routine adoption of these standards is still not straightforward. 
Data sharing is minimal and often still shared within paywalled published articles rather than in open repositories. An assessment of open science practices in phytolith research (Karoune 2020) found only a small percentage of reusable data. These results, and the need to raise awareness of the benefits of wider data sharing, initiated this project to take the first steps along the FAIRification journey. 

Our FAIRification approach: 
Community survey - about their data sharing practices to gain a better insight into the current barriers and training needs. 
Open-source project - fully accessible and we are inviting contributors to work with us. This will hopefully lead to greater implementation of our outputs by researchers. 
FAIR data assessment - exploring existing phytolith data from published articles. We will be working with researchers whose data is within our dataset to train them in FAIRifying phytolith data. This work can then be used to develop tools for FAIR assessment and model best practice for the rest of our community. 

We understand this work cannot be completed without consensus in the phytolith community therefore this approach will be used to build a collaborative strategy to move forward with the FAIRification of phytolith data.
