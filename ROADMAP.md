# Roadmap for PROJECT TITLE

PROJECT TITLE has grown from initial efforts by Emma Karoune to raise awareness of issues with poor data sharing practice within the community of phytolith researchers. It is part of a broader initiative supported by the International Phytolith Society ([IPS](https://phytoliths.org/)) on data sharing and represents the first steps towards the [FAIRification](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) of phytolith data.

Please check out our contribution guidelines and [code of conduct](https://github.com/open-phytoliths/FAIRer_phytoliths/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to help you get started, and the [README](https://github.com/open-phytoliths/FAIRer_phytoliths/blob/main/README.md) for an overview if you have not read it yet!

## Milestone 1: Establish a working group and needed infrastructure - short term (May 2021)
* Open a GitHub repository.
* Designing a webpage to advertise and promote the project to the phytolith community and to gain contributors.
* ...Something else?

## Milestone 2: FAIR assessment of existing data - medium term (October 2021)
* Gather information about data sharing practices, expectations and predisposition within the phytolith community via a survey.
* Conduct a FAIR assessment of phytolith sharing data using two regional studies: Europe and South America.
* ...Something else?

## Milestone 3: Development of guidelines for existing datasets and future FAIR phytolith data - long-term (May 2022)
* Create and publish a protocol for phytolith (raw) data publication and sharing.
* Publish a peer-reviewed open-access research article to share findings of the FAIR assessment and the new data sharing criteria.
* ...Something else?

## Milestone 4: Community building and training for FAIRification - throughout the project
* Institute an official standing committee of the International Phytolith Society (IPS).
* Disseminate the project's mission in academic environments:
  *  Conference paper at the [12th International Meeting for Phytolith Research](https://www.12impr.uni-kiel.de/en?set_language=en), September 2021.
* ...Something else?
