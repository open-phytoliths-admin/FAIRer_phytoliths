### Action points:
1. EK will send an email to confirm the author'slist order before we submit it this upcoming Monday and to start working on the FAIR assessment paper.
2. Looking for extra fundings: 
- CZI funding application for maintenance of open science (coding,..) could work for ontologies
- find someone to create an online database
3. Using conference infrastructure such as IPS,Reading conference to catch up with phytolith researchers. Going to them rather than making them coming to us.





### Next meeting: 11th November (3pm Spanish time)- 28th OCtober is already taken with the ICOPS meeting.
