* Data paper:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E0Bpq4L1H6QquMXNuwA_2bl1t_OBGENcO9OkvkULe_M/edit?usp=sharing
Final check before submission: 
- Only table 1 - specifications table - and table 2 - data dictionary - will appear in the text. All the other tables are accessible 
in the GitHub repository. This is because Scientific data only allows table that does not exceed one page.

- There is also a flowchart figure to check at the end of the google doc.
