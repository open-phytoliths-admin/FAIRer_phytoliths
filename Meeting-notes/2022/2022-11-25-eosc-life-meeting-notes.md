    - Some variables are quite rich and are presenting interesting angles to discuss phytolith studies diversity (e.g  methodological specificities, period naming, type of studies variables...)and might feed the FAIR guidelines content
    - what kind of analysis would we like to carry out? MCA like for the survey paper?
   
2.  ICOPS meeting is set on December 2nd
* FAIR Data Check list created by Emma: present results of the assessment and show the chacklist nad explain how we would like to proceed (maybe also asked for some help?)
* Yong Ge will introduce himself
* We need to schedule a specific meeting for discussing this  the classification and standardization of phytoliths

### Notes:

1. Javi is almost done, almost ready to be submit
2. FAIR guidelines: difficulties with making Interoperability and Reusability simple, not too much technical 
 Carla: to cover the principles with a simple, visual points
MM - make a diagram - if you do that, what result comes from this on the FAIR principles.
3. People form ICPN do not seem keen to participte in the ontology work. One last try to connect to RM Albert as she expressed some interest in it. Something else to talk to RM is the phytcore database and how to make it really an open access reference collection.


### Action points:
1. 
2. Some help for drafting the FAIR guideline
   /CK to put the FAIR check tools that are already existing.
3. MM will submit a presentation proposal 'Rethinking data sharing in phytolith research: from FAIR phytoliths to key insights for the future' to the XXI INQUA Congress 2023 - Session 108: Equitable and ethical knowledge production in Quaternary Science.



### Next meeting: 7th December (3pm Spanish time)
