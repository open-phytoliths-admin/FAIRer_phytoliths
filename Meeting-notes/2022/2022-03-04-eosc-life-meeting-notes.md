### Notes:

1. Survey - paper is progressing. written a summary of the data and will add the MCA. Some data needs to be removed, anonymised from the table. There is interesting mismatch of understanding between what researchers think they do and what they actually do ( example of reproducibility of data).  Keeping position and have or will publish pre-prints.
    - Survey paper - PLOS and Plants - Elife - Frontiers in Plant Science   
- Survey and data papers: To think of the FAIR principles such as themes to structure both article discussion (or methods for the data paper)
2. Meeting with Henriette went well and she is working on preparing a first instance of an ontology for our case study. The idea is to have evryhing open on a repository that can be checked and updated with use
