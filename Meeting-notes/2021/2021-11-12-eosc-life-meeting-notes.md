# FAIR Phytolith Project Meeting

### Date: 2021-11-12

### Roll call:
* Emma
* Juanjo
* Celine
* Javi (29th Nov to 15th Dec fieldwork)

### Agenda:
1. FAIR assessment
2. Training funding call from EOSC - FAIR training 
3. Prototype (EOSC Life proposition) - example of FAIRifying and combining datasets.
4. Community building 
    - [Open canvas and collaboration plan](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ngwTccbBRtF7KwFtVpSILg8soxRt1W3YlE-n7nNu4wo/edit?usp=sharing)
    - [Mountain of Engagement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OVWcurkf6H4ex8sxCJAHbgGslgEPUZP6Ieor0Ab6g-o/edit?usp=sharing)
5. Survey - update. 
6. AOB


### Notes:

1. South America - Javier has done his articles. Rest of us are half way through. On track for the end of December deadline. 
2. We need to apply for the EOSC training call funding - we are making training material but will not have time to deliver this - maybe a trial run at IWGP next June.
3. Prototype FAIRifying datasets - South Asian sites - Emma's and Juanjo. IPCN - only limited amount of names - a lot of different types that we have to then name.
    * Can we just take the ICPN types? or will we lose too much information. 
    * types of morphotypes that are specific to the region
    * Silica skeletons -  differently treated - some just count them as 1 silica skeleton and some include the single cells in their overall count.
    * Do we not use silica skeletons?
    * Needs more discussion
    * EK - maybe concentrating on F, A rather than I and R? - Data lake approach? what is the minimum amount of information needed to make these data reusable?
4. EK - sharing examples of planning communities - we can use our project as an example to show ICOPS so we can do this with them and get their input, find out about how much time/commitment they can make and what ideas they have for projects and engaging with the phytolith community. 
5. Survey we now have 68 responses. Enquiry from China about not being able to access the form - maybe we should put an alternative on our website?

    

### Action points:
1. Continue with FAIR assessment data collection.
2. Emma and Juanjo will meet to discuss combining their datasets. 
3. Prepare together the Mountains of Engagement for the ICOPS meeting (How we can engage with the ICOPS members, follow up with their expectations and see how to interact with them).
4. On November 19th to meet and discuss with Li Ying the possibility to organize roundtable about Open Science at the 2022 Indo Pacific Prehistory Association (IPPA) and EAA conferences.

### Next meeting: 26th November - 3pm (Spanish time)ES
