### Agenda:
1. FAIR assessment is done for Europe
   Moderation meeting! 
*    Should we collect more data? CL is back and might have some ideas about it.
*    Do we need to set another group for the various methods (counting, type of study...) of the phytolith articles?
*    EK will work on adding in the info from the unpaywall list that Javi created as it does not seem to be as straightforward as we thought. 
2. FAIR community reaches 82 participants for the survey 1 and 44 for the survey 2.
*  CL started to smooth the answers to get a better visibility of the results.
3. Participation to conferences in 2022

### Notes:

1. Moderation -
    * Counting method - if does not apply change to Not applicable? Define counting method as clearly 'counting of phytolith morphotypes on slides'. 
    * Study type - Can choose more than one for study type? Does this affect our analysis? - what is the main goal of the study? why are they doing the study?

- spread of the data - looking at both sets together. - CL look in to the data saturation of the data. 

2. Survey - CL has cleaned the data and prepared it for R. CL - will put the survey in the FAIR phyto google drive. 
    * 82 but 1 person was an archaebotanist. so total is 81.  
3. IWGP 2022 - Wait and see 
  



### Action points:

1. FAIR assessors - go back and look at queries about counting method and study type. Bring back to next meeting any queries that are different from this. 
    * CL to look at data saturation for the two datasets. 
2. CL to start analysing the survey data. 
3. CK, EK and CL - finalise the draft for womens arch conf.
    * In the new year - write abstract for EAA session and look at CAA conference.
4. EK and JGG - arrange a meeting in the new year to look at south asian data harmonisation.
