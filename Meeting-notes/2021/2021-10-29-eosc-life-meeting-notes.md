### Notes:

1. No major observations
2. Key risk: Community engagement - Do you have examples from other disciplines that we can look at?
* Scaling up if everyone takes this on
* Publishing - how to tackle them - different way of going. 
* Once we have our community in place - how do we interact with others - integrate with others - tools etc. 

3. Juanjo proposed to go for a poster or a talk focusing on how profitable the FAIR project is.IWGP meeting: CK can present the initial results
