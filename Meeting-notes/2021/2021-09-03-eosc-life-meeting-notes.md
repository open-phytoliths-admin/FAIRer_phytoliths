Find google scholar list downloading - With Publish or Perish software (https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish) you can run keyword queries on Google Scholar from there, and export the results to .csv.
Look at reference management systems. 
Planning - breakdown into smaller tasks - look at what has been planned in spreadsheet/github.
